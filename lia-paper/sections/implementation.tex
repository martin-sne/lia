\label{implementation}
Three HTML of different sizes have been created to be compared. These pages reflect the sizes that can be encountered in most common websites and has been derived from top 100 websites statistics \cite{httparchive}. The pages size are:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | }
    \hline
    title & size (bits) & number of requests \\ \hline \hline
    small.html &  20458 & 3 \\ \hline
    medium.html &  624048 & 8\\ \hline 
    large.html &  & 49 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center} 
Other fixed parameters have been set-up:

In order to have relevant results, the tests have been performed ten times and the average results will be presented in the next section. In order to make the benchmarking easier and more coherent some scripts have been implemented.
