\label{req}
In order to conduct this research we use one server that runs a webserver and responds to both versions of HTTP, HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 \cite{http2-imp}. That instance will run on of our student servers. AWS medium-instances, provided by the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) \cite{amazon} infrastructure, will be used as clients to perform several benchmark tests that try to cover real life scenarios.
