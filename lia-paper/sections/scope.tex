\section{Scope}
\label{scope}
The scope of this research is to conduct benchmarks of the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocol, using different static and dynamic parameters and compare them among each other. Static parameters are the distance between client/server (RTT) and the page size, whereas dynamic parameters are the number of requests and the number of concurrent clients. Therefore we will implement three different HTML pages with different sizes and benchmark them from three different geographical locations. The tests will be implemented using the secured version of the protocols with TLS enabled. We do not focus on implementing the new features of the HTTP/2 protocol like server push capabilities.
