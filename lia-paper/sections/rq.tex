\section{Research Questions}
\label{chap:rq}
To conduct the research the following research questions have been formulated: \\
\\
How do the new features of the  HTTP/2 protocol improve the performance for frequently visited webpages/webserver? 
\\
\\
That question can be narrowed down to some sub questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item What are possible drawbacks that can occur for large web service providers when switching from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 ?
\item What is the predictable impact that could be related to changes in the infrastructure of Web service providers?
\item What is the difference in bandwidth utilization between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 considering the size ratio of header and data for multiple concurrent sessions on a server?
\item How much can HTTP/2 decrease the amount of data when considering header compression and using multiple streams within one TCP Session compared to HTTP/1.1 on a server ?
\item What is the impact regarding the response time experienced by a client when the number of concurrent requests / clients increases seen from three different geographical locations?
\item What is the impact to the load and CPU utilization to the server when conducting the benchmark tests?
\end{itemize}
